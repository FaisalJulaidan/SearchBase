            We currently offer a full all-round integration with Mercury. You can simply login with your Mercury
            credentials and we will read and write all of data processed by our platform and the chatbots that you have
            created.

        <Paragraph>
            For your integration to start, you will need to request some information from Mercury.
            What you’ll need:
            <ul>
                <li>Username</li>
                <li>Password</li>
            </ul>
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            You can request both information by heading to this link:
            <Text code style={{margin: '0 0 0 5px'}}>
                {/*<a href="https://www.Mercury.com/uk/technical-support-2/" target={'_blank'}*/}
                {/*style={{cursor: 'pointer'}}>*/}
                {/*https://www.Mercury.com/uk/technical-support-2/*/}
                {/*</a>*/}
            </Text>.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
            Once you have the necessary information, you can simply start using Mercury + TheSearchBase.
