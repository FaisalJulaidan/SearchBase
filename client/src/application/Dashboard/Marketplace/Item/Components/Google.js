            For your integration to start, you will need to request some information from Bullhorn.
            What youâ€™ll need:
            <ul>
                <li>Username</li>
                <li>Password</li>
            </ul>
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            You can request both information by heading to this link:
            <Text code style={{margin: '0 0 0 5px'}}>
                <a href="https://www.bullhorn.com/uk/technical-support-2/" target={'_blank'}
                   style={{cursor: 'pointer'}}>

                </a>
            </Text>.
